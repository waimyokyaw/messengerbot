I have created this test application based on the article and you can read more about creating app on facebook there. https://medium.com/crowdbotics/how-to-create-your-very-own-facebook-messenger-bot-with-dialogflow-and-node-js-in-just-one-day-f5f2f5792be5

As said in the article, we can extend and do more with our messenger bot.
This is a working example and hope it helps.

Thank you.
